# MC Hax Challenge
## Hosted by: ML-Astra

### The Basics

A first to 100 points challenge for programmers and newbies alike.

The challenge is to create a Minecraft hacked client with either Java or Scala using any legal mod framework of your choice as long as it is compatible with Minecraft version 1.15.

From the start of the challenge, you will have 1 week to create your client before the first battle.
A newly generated 1.15 map will be started with a count down of 3 hours until PvP is enabled. Last player standing will be awarded 25 Points with the points decreasing until 10th place is awarded 1 point. 
This challenge is meant for newbies and pros alike so as a result de-compiling and looking through existing hacked clients like Wurst, Wolfram, Impact, LiquidBounce is all allowed but all code must be your own or a Clean-Room implementation. 

The only exception to this will be things like event managers which can be hard to code for newbies.

### The Rules

    - Exception to this rule are hard to create components like event managers.
    - If clarification on if a piece of code can be used then please ask.
